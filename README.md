## Project Description

The Online Code Editor is a web-based tool designed to help users write and test HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code conveniently. It provides a simple and intuitive interface where users can write their code in separate sections for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The editor then dynamically updates a preview section to show the output of the code in real-time. This project is especially useful for developers and learners who want to experiment with code snippets, test small projects, or quickly prototype ideas without the need for a local development environment.

## Features

- Separate sections for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code input.
- Real-time preview of code output.
- Syntax highlighting for better code readability.
- Responsive design, ensuring compatibility with various devices and screen sizes.

## Usage

1. Open the Online Code Editor in your web browser.
2. Write your HTML code in the HTML section, CSS code in the CSS section, and JavaScript code in the JavaScript section.
3. As you type, the preview section will update in real-time to show the output of your code.
